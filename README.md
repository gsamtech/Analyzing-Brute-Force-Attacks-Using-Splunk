1. Source Specification and Initial Filtering:
bash
Copy code
source="brute-force-sample.csv" host="kali" index="bruteforce" sourcetype="csv"
What it does: This portion of the query searches the bruteforce index for events from a specific source file (brute-force-sample.csv), where the host is identified as "kali," and the events are from a CSV file format.
2. Stats Aggregation:
csharp
Copy code
| stats count by _time, user, action, signature_id, dest
What it does: This command groups the events by _time, user, action, signature_id, and dest. It also counts how many occurrences there are for each unique combination. This helps in organizing the events for further analysis.
3. First Streamstats Command (Creating a Running Count):
sql
Copy code
| streamstats global=true count current=false by user, action
What it does: This uses the streamstats command to generate a running count of events for each user and action. Setting global=true calculates the count across all time, while current=false excludes the current event from the count (so it only counts previous events).
4. Second Streamstats Command (Tracking Previous Events):
sql
Copy code
| streamstats global=true current=false last(count) as last_count last(action) as last_action by user
What it does: This command tracks two fields for each user: last_count (the previous count of events) and last_action (the previous action taken by the user). It looks at previous events instead of the current one, which is useful for identifying patterns.
5. Filtering Based on Login Attempts:
sql
Copy code
| search last_action="failure" AND action="success" AND last_count>=4 AND count=0
What it does: This step filters out users who meet the following conditions:
The previous action (last_action) was a failure.
The current action is a success.
There were at least 4 failed attempts (last_count>=4).
The current count is 0, which indicates that the successful login follows multiple failures.
6. Creating a New Field for Failure Count:
bash
Copy code
| eval failure_count=last_count+1
What it does: This creates a new field called failure_count, which represents the total number of failures before the successful login by adding 1 to last_count (the count of previous failed attempts).
7. Removing Unnecessary Fields:
sql
Copy code
| fields - last_action, count, last_count
What it does: This removes the fields last_action, count, and last_count from the final output, leaving only the essential data.
8. Converting the _time Field to a Readable Format:
perl
Copy code
| convert ctime(_time) timeformat="%d/%m/%Y %T"
What it does: This converts the _time field into a human-readable format, like DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS, making it easier to interpret the timestamps in the results.
Summary of the Query's Purpose:
The query identifies users who have made at least 4 consecutive failed login attempts followed by a successful login.
It tracks and displays the number of failures (via failure_count) before the user finally logs in successfully.
This can be useful for detecting potential brute-force login attempts, where an attacker tries several incorrect passwords before eventually succeeding.
This query provides insights that can help security teams monitor and respond to brute-force attack patterns.**
